This is a solar system orrery, a model of the solar system based on 
circular orbits and planets moving at constant speed based on Kepler's
third law and their approximate orbital radii in astronomical units.

This is more LISP-like and probably not idiomatic Clojure.  I'm not sure
if I'm sacrificing any performance but this is a short program.

## To run

```
clojure orrery.cl
```
